## Ansible
By creating this dedicated folder, I am demonstrating a structured approach to experimentation,
which will help me keep my experiments organized and repeatable.
Additionally, by experimenting with **Ansible** across multiple cloud platforms,
I am gaining valuable experience with using **Ansible** in different environments
and learning about any nuances or differences between each platform.

Overall, this approach will help me build a strong foundation in using **Ansible** for cloud automation, 
which can be a valuable skill for my career in IT, DevOps, or cloud computing.
